Features
--------

South Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

django-pgfields 0.9.2 adds out-of-the-box support for South_, the popular
migrations application for Django. With this release, all fields
provided by django-pgfields are given appropriate introspection rules for
South.

This also applies to any subclasses of ``CompositeField``, which are given
automatic introspection rules. This does *not* examine your subclass,
however, so it is your responsibility to `add introspection rules`_ if your
subclass takes constructor arguments.
