===================
django-pgfields 1.0
===================

Welcome to django-pgfields 1.0!

Overview
--------

This release is considered the first true, stable release of
django-pgfields. It adds sufficient support for tools within the Django
ecosystem (gis, south) to be usable, and all documented aspects of the
module should not change at this point, except to accomodate a substantial
change in Django itself.

This release of django-pgfields contains the following major features:

Features
--------

* Added an `improved repr <#improved-repr>`_ implementation to Model.

Improved Repr
-------------

django-pgfields 1.0 provides an improved ``__repr__`` implementation on
the base Model, from which your models inherit.

As this is not the core mission of django-pgfields, this functionality is
provided on an opt-in basis, and will only be activated if you set a particular setting.

For more information, see the
`improved repr documentation <../misc.html#improved-repr>`_.

Minor Improvements
------------------

* If ``auto_add=True`` is set on a UUID field, it now implies
  ``editable=False``. This makes it behave as much like AutoField as possible,
  since a primary key replacement is one of the most likely reasons to use
  auto_add at all.
